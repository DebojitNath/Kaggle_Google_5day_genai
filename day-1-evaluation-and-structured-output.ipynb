    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course. In this notebook, you'll learn some techniques for evaluating the output of a language model. As part of the evaluation, you will also use Gemini's structured data capability to produce evaluation results as instances of Python types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This notebook is more code-heavy than the first Day 1 notebook ([Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/)). This notebook is not a prerequisite for days 2 and beyond, so feel free to skip over it, or come back later in the week. If you have not yet tried the [Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/) notebook, start there first as it introduces the fundamentals for interacting with LLMs.\n",

       "*   **Multimodal and Multilingual Data:** The model is trained on a diverse dataset that includes text, images, audio, and video content. The text data is sourced from various domains, including web documents and code.\n",

       "**2. Architecture:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer:** Gemini 1.5 Pro is based on a sparse MoE Transformer architecture. This allows the model to have a large number of parameters while only activating a subset for any given input.\n",

       "**3. Infrastructure:**\n",

It uses a MoE Transformer architecture and undergoes pre-training, instruction tuning, and human preference tuning. The training process incorporates improvements across the model stack to enable long-context understanding and overall performance."

    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### LLM limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
